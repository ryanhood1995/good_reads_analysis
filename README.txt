The purpose of this project is to analyse good reads data.  At the time of writing this, I have only one
Jupyter Notebook called good_reads_one which contains some basic analysis of some good reads data.  If I
add more notebooks to this project, they will be two, three, etc.  In addition to the notebooks, I have provided
some images produced using Tableau which help with the visualization of the data sets.
